## introduction
Happy Farm" was a once-popular Facebook game. To reminisce about those good times, a text-based farming game inspired by its style has been designed. The distinctive feature of this game lies in its daily changing weather conditions, which affect plant growth. Additionally, players can choose from different professions, and there are special plants available that can help regular plants yield better harvest results
## How to play
Open cmd in code file first, then input 'java hw5' to start the game. 

This game is mainly about planting, with nine plots arranged in a grid pattern. When the program is initially executed, users will see a welcome screen. The system will then prompt for the user's name and select a profession. After inputting these details, the game can begin. At the start of each new day, the system will display the day number, weather conditions, current stamina, and money. Players will then have various commands they can execute:

1. water [plot number] (water the plant in the specified plot)
2. fill and loosen [soil type] [plot number] (add soil and loosen it)
3. plant [plant name] [plot number] (plant a specified plant)
4. reap and sell [plant name] [plot number] (harvest the plant and sell it)
5. buy [item in shop] (purchase items from the shop)
6. check (check various statuses of the plots)
7. store (view items available in the shop)
8. bag (view all items and statuses currently held)
9. sleep (end the current day and proceed to the next)
10. help (provide player assistance)

Some commands may require certain actions to be completed beforehand. The system will remind users of what needs to be done before executing these commands. These commands repeat in a loop until the player is penniless, has no plants planted, or there are no environmental factors left for the day, signaling the end of the game.
